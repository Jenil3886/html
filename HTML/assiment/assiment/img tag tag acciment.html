    <p>Bhagat Singh was one of the most prominent and renowned freedom fighters
    of India. He was a socialist revolutionary who bravely fought for the independence 
    of the country.<b> He was born in <mark>September 1907</mark> in Banga village in Punjab</b> to a
    Sikh family.<b> His father's name was<mark> Kishan Singh</mark></b> and<b> his mother's name was <mark>Vidyavati.</mark></b></p>
    <p>Some of his family members were active participants in the Indian Independence Movement, while others were part of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s army.
     He was a strong supporter of the Swadeshi Movement.
     In later years, his trust in non-violence withered. He began to believe that only
      armed rebellion could bring independence.
       He was then highly influenced by Lala Lajpat Rai.
     When Lala Lajpat Rai died after a lathi charge ordered by a British police superintendent,
      Bhagat Singh decided to avenge his death.
     He, along with his associates, was charged and found guilty of killing a British
      police officer.
     Bhagat Singh was hanged on 23 March 1931 in Lahore along with his associates, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev.</p>
     <P> On 30th October 1928 when Lala Lajpat Rai was leading a march against the Simon Commission, he was lathi-charged by then Superintendent of Police James Scott. Rai was severely injured and later succumbed to the injuries. The incident had prompted Bhagat Singh to take revenge of Lalaji’s death.</P>

   <P> Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Chandrasekhar Azad planned to kill Scott. They killed a probationary Police officer Saunders instead, in a case of mistaken identity. However, after the incident, they claimed Saunders as their actual target and evaded arrest by changing identities.</P>

   <P>Execution</P>

    <P>Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were booked in the Saunders murder case. The case became popular as the Lahore Conspiracy Case. The three were handed death sentences and were ordered to be hanged on 24th March 1931.

    Fearing public outcry and resentment, the authorities hanged them 11 hours before, that is, on the night of 23rd March 1931. Their bodies were secretly taken out and cremated on the bank of River Sutlej. Their ashes were thrown in the river.</P>
