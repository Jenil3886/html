    <p>Dwarka is considered as the first capital of Gujarat. The city's name literally means gateway. Dwarka has also been referred to throughout its history as<mark> <font color="red">"Mokshapuri"</font></mark>,<mark> <font color="red">"Dwarkamati"</font></mark>, and<mark><font color="red"> "Dwarkavati"</font></mark>. It is mentioned in the ancient epic period of the Mahabharata. According to legend, Krishna settled here after he defeated and killed his uncle Kamsa at Mathura.This mythological account of Krishna's migration to Dwarka from Mathura is closely associated with the culture of Gujarat. Krishna is also said to have reclaimed 12 yojanas or 96 square kilometres (37 sq mi) of land from the sea to create Dwarka.</p>
