	 <h3> Geometry: polygons </h3>
      

<p>A polygon is a geometric plane figure made of straight lines also called segments. Polygons are categorized based on their number of sides. Examples of categories of polygons are:</p>

  <ul type=disc> 
  	<li>Triangle: A geometric figure made of three sides (called edges) and three angles (called vertices). Triangles are categorized by the relationships among the edges:
    </li>		
  	</ul>

   <ul type=circle>
   	<li>Equalateral: All sides have the same length </li>
   	<li> Isosceles: Two of the sides have the same length</li>
    <li> Scalene: All sides have different lengths </li>
   </ul>
  <ul type=disc>

    <li> Quadrilateral: A geometric figure made of four sides (called edges) and four angles (called corners). Quadrilaterals are categorized by the relationships among the sides. namely whether the opposite sides are equal, whether the opposite sides are parallel or not, etc. Examples of quadrilaterals are:
    </li>
</ul>
      <ul type=circle>
       <li> Convex Quadrilaterals (also called parallelograms): The opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Examples are:</li>

          <ul type=square> 
            <li> square: All four sides are equal and all (four) angles are right</li>

            <li>Rectangle: Each two opposite sides are equal and all (four) angles are right (two adjacent sides may have different lengths)</li>

            <li>Rhombus: All four sides are equal but, while opposite angles are equal, the angles may not be equal (this would differential a rhombus from a suare)</li>
        </ul>
          <ul type=circle>

             <li> Others: At least one of the rules of parallelogram is not respected. Examples are:</li>
           </ul>
           
           <ul type=square>  

             <li> kite: Adjacent sides are equal and opposite angles are equal </li>

             <li>Trapezoid: At least two opposite sides are equal. Two variants of the trapezoid are:</li>

             <li>Isosceles</li>

             <li>Tangential</li>
            </un>
            
          <ul type=disc>   

             <li> Others: This is for polygons made of five or more sides. Examples are:</li>
           </ul>

          <ul type=circle> 

             <li>Pentagon: Made of 5 sides</li>

             <li>Hexagon: Made of 6 sides</li>

             <li> Octagon: Made of 8 sides</li>

             <li>Decagon: Made of 10 sides</li>

             <li>Dodegagon: Made of 12 sides</li>
           </ul>
